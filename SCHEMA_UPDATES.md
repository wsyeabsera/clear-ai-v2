# Schema Updates - Enhanced Waste Management API

## Overview
This document summarizes the enhancements made to the Waste Management API to support better waste composition analysis and contaminant detection.

## Date
October 11, 2025

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Shipment Model
Added fields for better waste tracking:
- `waste_type`: Type of waste (e.g., "plastic", "metal", "paper")
- `waste_code`: Waste classification code
- `carrier`: Transport company name
- `composition_notes`: Description of waste composition

### 2. Enhanced Contaminant Model
Added fields from Wasteer API for detailed analysis:
- `analysis_notes`: Detailed analysis notes
- `waste_item_detected`: Specific waste item that was detected
- `explosive_level`: Level of explosive risk ("low", "medium", "high")
- `so2_level`: Sulfur dioxide level ("low", "medium", "high")
- `hcl_level`: Hydrogen chloride level ("low", "medium", "high")
- `estimated_size`: Estimated size/volume (number)

### 3. Enhanced Facility Model
Added fields for better facility management:
- `accepted_waste_types`: Array of waste types the facility accepts
- `rejected_waste_types`: Array of waste types the facility rejects
- `contact_email`: Contact email address
- `contact_phone`: Contact phone number
- `operating_hours`: Operating hours description

### 4. Enhanced Inspection Model
Added fields for richer inspection data:
- `inspection_type`: Type of inspection ("arrival", "processing", "departure", "random")
- `duration_minutes`: Duration of the inspection in minutes
- `passed`: Quick boolean status indicator
- `follow_up_required`: Whether follow-up action is needed
- `photos`: Array of photo URLs

### 5. New Analytics Endpoints

#### GET /api/analytics/contamination-rate
Returns overall contamination statistics:
- Total shipments count
- Contaminated vs clean shipments
- Contamination rate percentage
- Risk level distribution

#### GET /api/analytics/facility-performance
Returns facility performance metrics:
- Total inspections per facility
- Acceptance/rejection/pending counts
- Acceptance rate percentage

#### GET /api/analytics/waste-type-distribution
Returns waste type distribution:
- Shipment count by waste type
- Total weight by waste type
- Contamination rates by waste type

#### GET /api/analytics/risk-trends
Returns contaminant risk trends over time:
- Daily breakdown of risk levels
- Configurable time period (default 30 days)
- Total contaminants per day

## Database Changes

All existing data was preserved. New fields are optional (nullable) to maintain backward compatibility.

### Seed Data Updates
- 10 facilities with enhanced contact information and waste type acceptance rules
- 12 shipments with waste type classification and carrier information
- 8 contaminants with detailed analysis notes and chemical level measurements
- 12 inspections with type classification and duration tracking

## API Backward Compatibility

All changes are backward compatible:
- New fields are optional
- Existing endpoints continue to work unchanged
- Old data without new fields will simply have those fields as undefined/null

## Testing

All endpoints have been tested and verified:
- ✅ Enhanced CRUD operations for all resources
- ✅ New analytics endpoints returning correct data
- ✅ Validation schemas updated for new fields
- ✅ Database seed working with enhanced data
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful

## Files Modified

1. **Type Definitions**: `src/tools/types.ts`
2. **Mongoose Models**:
   - `src/api/models/Shipment.ts`
   - `src/api/models/Facility.ts`
   - `src/api/models/Contaminant.ts`
   - `src/api/models/Inspection.ts`
3. **Validation Schemas**:
   - `src/api/routes/shipments.ts`
   - `src/api/routes/facilities.ts`
   - `src/api/routes/contaminants.ts`
   - `src/api/routes/inspections.ts`
4. **New Files**:
   - `src/api/routes/analytics.ts` (new analytics endpoints)
5. **Route Index**: `src/api/routes/index.ts`
6. **Seed Data**: `src/api/db/seed.ts`
7. **Documentation**: `API.md`

## Next Steps

The API now supports:
1. ✅ Tracking waste shipments with detailed composition information
2. ✅ Analyzing waste composition and detecting contaminants with chemical levels
3. ✅ Managing facilities with waste acceptance policies
4. ✅ Comprehensive analytics for contamination trends and facility performance

## Notes

- The schema was intentionally kept simple, avoiding the full complexity of the Wasteer API
- Contaminants remain as a standalone model (not derived from WasteItemRules)
- No multi-tenancy (client_uid) was added
- No UUID migration was performed
- Authentication system was not implemented
