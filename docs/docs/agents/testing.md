## Testing Philosophy

### Test Pyramid

```
        ╱╲
       ╱  ╲     E2E Tests (20)
      ╱────╲    - Full pipeline
     ╱      ╲   - Real services
    ╱────────╲  
   ╱          ╲ Integration Tests (102)
  ╱────────────╲ - Agent integration
 ╱              ╲ - Real LLM & API
╱────────────────╲ Unit Tests (655)
                   - Fast, isolated
                   - Mocked dependencies
```

### Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Fast feedback (< 1s per test)
   - Mock all external dependencies
   - Test business logic in isolation
   - Run on every code change

2. **Integration Tests**: Real service validation (1-10s per test)
   - Use real LLM (OpenAI)
   - Use real API (waste management)
   - Mock optional services (Memory)
   - Run before commits

3. **E2E Tests**: Complete pipeline validation (3-10s per test)
   - All agents working together
   - Real user scenarios
   - Run before releases

## Running Tests

### All Tests

```bash
# Run all tests (unit + integration)
yarn test:all

# With coverage report
yarn test:coverage
```

### Unit Tests Only

```bash
# Run unit tests (fast, < 20s)
yarn test

# Watch mode for development
yarn test:watch

# Specific component
yarn test src/tests/agents/planner.test.ts
```

### Integration Tests

```bash
# Run all integration tests (~2 minutes)
yarn test:integration

# Run specific integration test suite
yarn jest src/tests/integration/agents/planner.integration.test.ts

# Run with detailed output
yarn test:integration --verbose
```

### Specific Test Patterns

```bash
# Run tests matching pattern
yarn jest --testNamePattern="should execute shipments"

# Run tests in specific file
yarn jest executor.integration.test.ts

# Run with timeout for slow tests
yarn jest --testTimeout=60000
```

            tool: 'shipments_list',
            params: { limit: 10 }
          }]
        })
      })
    };

    const planner = new PlannerAgent(mockLLM as any);
    const plan = await planner.plan('Get shipments');

    expect(plan.steps).toHaveLength(1);
    expect(plan.steps[0].tool).toBe('shipments_list');
  });
});
```

### Executor Unit Test

```typescript
describe('ExecutorAgent', () => {
  it('should execute parallel steps', async () => {
    const mockTool = {
      execute: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({
        success: true,
        data: []
      })
    };

    const mockMCP = {
      getTool: jest.fn().mockReturnValue(mockTool)
    };

    const executor = new ExecutorAgent(mockMCP as any);
    
    const plan = {
      steps: [
        { tool: 'tool1', params: {}, parallel: true },
        { tool: 'tool2', params: {}, parallel: true }
      ]
    };

});
```

## Integration Test Setup

### Test Environment

```typescript
// Before all tests
beforeAll(async () => {
  // 1. Initialize real LLM
  const llmConfigs = getLLMConfigs();
  const llm = new LLMProvider(llmConfigs);

  // 2. Initialize memory with mocks
  const mockNeo4j = { /* mock methods */ };
  const mockPinecone = { /* mock methods */ };
  const memory = new MemoryManager(config, mockNeo4j, mockPinecone);
  await memory.connect();

  // 3. Initialize MCP server with real tools
  const mcpServer = new MCPServer('test', '1.0.0');
  registerAllTools(mcpServer, 'http://localhost:4000/api');

  // 4. Create agents
  const planner = new PlannerAgent(llm, mcpServer);
  const executor = new ExecutorAgent(mcpServer);
  const analyzer = new AnalyzerAgent(llm);
  const summarizer = new SummarizerAgent(llm);

  // 5. Create orchestrator
  orchestrator = new OrchestratorAgent(
    planner, executor, analyzer, summarizer, memory
  );
}, 30000);

afterAll(async () => {
  await memory.close();
});
```

### Test Data Management

## Writing Integration Tests

### Basic Template

```typescript
describe('MyAgent Integration', () => {
  let agent: MyAgent;

  beforeAll(async () => {
    // Initialize with real services
    agent = new MyAgent(realLLM, realConfig);
  }, 30000);

  it('should handle real scenario', async () => {
    const result = await agent.doSomething();

    expect(result).toBeDefined();
    expect(result.success).toBe(true);

    console.log('Result:', result);
  }, 60000);  // Longer timeout for real LLM calls
});
```

### Best Practices

1. **Use real services for integration tests**
   - Real LLM calls (OpenAI)
   - Real API calls
   - Mock only expensive external services (Neo4j, Pinecone)

2. **Increase timeouts**
   - LLM calls: 30-60 seconds
   - Complex queries: 60-120 seconds
   - Default jest timeout: 5 seconds (too short)

3. **Handle LLM non-determinism**
   - Don't assert exact text matches
   - Check for patterns or keywords
   - Use flexible assertions
   - Accept multiple valid outputs

4. **Log outputs for debugging**
   - Use console.log for important data
   - Helps debug integration issues
   - Provides documentation value

5. **Clean environment**
   - Seed database before tests
   - Clear state between test suites
   - Use separate test database

## CI/CD Setup

### GitHub Actions Example

```yaml
name: Tests

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    
    services:
      mongodb:
        image: mongo:7
        ports:
          - 27017:27017

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      
      - run: yarn install
      
      - run: yarn build
      
      - run: yarn test
        env:
          OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
      
      - run: yarn test:integration
        if: github.event_name == 'push' && github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
        env:
          OPENAI_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.OPENAI_API_KEY }}
          WASTEER_API_URL: http://localhost:4000/api
```

## Test Data Fixtures

### Shipment Fixtures

```typescript
export const mockShipments = [
  {
    id: "S1",
    facility_id: "F1",
    date: "2025-10-05",
    status: "delivered",
    weight_kg: 1500,
    has_contaminants: false,
    waste_type: "plastic"
  },
  {
    id: "S2",
    facility_id: "F2",
    date: "2025-10-06",
    status: "rejected",
    weight_kg: 800,
    has_contaminants: true,
    waste_type: "industrial"
  }
];
```

### Contaminant Fixtures

```typescript
export const mockContaminants = [
  {
    id: "C1",
    shipment_id: "S2",
    type: "Lead",
    risk_level: "high",
    concentration_ppm: 250,
    detected_at: "2025-10-06T10:30:00.000Z"
  }
];
```

## Mocking Strategies

### Mock LLM Provider

```typescript
const mockLLM = {
  generate: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue({
    content: JSON.stringify({
      steps: [{ tool: 'shipments_list', params: {} }]
    }),
    provider: 'mock'
  })
};
```

### Mock Memory System

```typescript
const mockMemory = {
  connect: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(undefined),
  close: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(undefined),
  querySemantic: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue([]),
  queryEpisodic: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue([]),
  storeSemantic: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue('id'),
  storeEpisodic: jest.fn().mockResolvedValue(undefined)
};
```

### Mock API Server

```typescript
import nock from 'nock';

nock('http://localhost:4000')
  .get('/api/shipments')
  .query(true)
  .reply(200, {
    success: true,
    data: mockShipments,
    count: 2
  });
```

## Troubleshooting Tests

### Tests Timing Out

**Issue**: Integration tests timeout

**Solutions**:
```typescript
// Increase timeout
it('test name', async () => {
  // test code
}, 60000);  // 60 seconds

// Or globally in jest.config.cjs
module.exports = {
  testTimeout: 60000
};
```

### LLM Rate Limits

**Issue**: Tests fail with rate limit errors

**Solutions**:
1. Add delays between tests
2. Use fewer integration tests in CI
3. Mock LLM for most tests
4. Use Groq as fallback (higher limits)

### Flaky Tests

**Issue**: Tests pass/fail inconsistently

**Solutions**:
1. LLM non-determinism: Use flexible assertions
2. Timing issues: Increase timeouts
3. State pollution: Clean database between runs
4. Race conditions: Add proper async/await

## Test Naming Conventions

```typescript
// Format: "should [action] [expected result]"

✅ Good:
"should generate plan for shipment query"
"should execute parallel steps successfully"
"should detect contamination anomalies"

❌ Bad:
"test 1"
"planner test"
"it works"
```
