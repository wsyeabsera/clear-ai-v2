## Scenario 2: Multi-Step Workflow - Handle Contaminated Shipment

### Task
1. Find shipments with high-risk contaminants
2. Get details of the most critical contamination
3. Update the shipment status to 'rejected'
4. Create a new inspection record documenting the rejection

### Reference Agent (Me) - Approach

#### Reasoning
This is a complex workflow requiring multiple steps. I need to identify high-risk contaminants, prioritize by risk level, update the shipment, and document the action. I'll start by finding high-risk contaminants, then work with the most critical one.

#### Steps
1. Find all high-risk contaminations
2. Identify the most critical (highest risk level + concentration)
3. Get shipment details for context
4. Update shipment status to 'rejected'
5. Create inspection record documenting the rejection

#### Tool Calls Made
```bash
# Step 1: Get high-risk contaminants
curl -s "http://localhost:3001/api/contaminants-detected?risk_level=high"

# Step 2: Get critical contaminants
curl -s "http://localhost:3001/api/contaminants-detected?risk_level=critical"

# Step 3: Get shipment details for critical contamination (S7 - Arsenic)
curl -s "http://localhost:3001/api/shipments/S7"

# Step 4: Update shipment status to rejected
curl -X PUT http://localhost:3001/api/shipments/S7 \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"status": "rejected"}'

# Step 5: Create inspection record
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/api/inspections \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "shipment_id": "S7",
    "facility_id": "F6",
    "date": "2025-10-13",
    "status": "rejected",
    "inspector": "Reference Agent",
    "notes": "Shipment rejected due to critical arsenic contamination detected",
    "contaminants_detected": ["Arsenic", "Lead"],
    "risk_assessment": "Critical risk - arsenic concentration 120ppm exceeds safety limits",
    "inspection_type": "processing",
    "duration_minutes": 90,
    "passed": false,
    "follow_up_required": true
  }'
```

#### Results
- **Step 1**: Found 3 high-risk contaminants (Lead, Cadmium, Mercury)
- **Step 2**: Found 1 critical contaminant (Arsenic in S7, 120ppm)
- **Step 3**: Shipment S7 details: 950kg from Mannheim to Stuttgart
- **Step 4**: Successfully updated S7 status to 'rejected'
- **Step 5**: Created inspection record I13 documenting rejection

#### Metrics
- **API Calls**: 5
- **Execution Time**: ~800ms
- **Success Rate**: 100%

## Scenario 3: Analytical Query - Contamination Analysis

### Task
Analyze contamination patterns by:
1. Getting overall contamination rate
2. Finding facilities with highest rejection rates
3. Identifying most common contaminant types
4. Calculating average contamination concentration by risk level

### Reference Agent (Me) - Approach

#### Reasoning
This requires multiple analytical queries to build a comprehensive picture. I'll gather data from different endpoints and perform calculations to identify patterns and insights.

#### Steps
1. Get overall contamination statistics
2. Get facility performance data
3. Analyze contaminant types and concentrations
4. Calculate averages and identify patterns

#### Tool Calls Made
```bash
# Step 1: Get overall contamination rate
curl -s "http://localhost:3001/api/analytics/contamination-rate"

# Step 2: Get facility performance data
curl -s "http://localhost:3001/api/analytics/facility-performance"

# Step 3: Get all contaminants for analysis
curl -s "http://localhost:3001/api/contaminants-detected"

# Step 4: Get waste distribution data
curl -s "http://localhost:3001/api/analytics/waste-distribution"
```

#### Results
- **Overall Contamination Rate**: 33.33% (4 out of 12 shipments)
- **Risk Distribution**: 1 critical, 3 high, 2 medium, 2 low
- **Facility Rejection Rates**: 
  - F2 (Berlin): 50% (1/2)
  - F6 (Stuttgart): 100% (1/1) 
  - F10 (Dortmund): 100% (1/1)
- **Most Common Contaminants**: Lead (2), Mercury (2), Arsenic (1), Cadmium (1)
- **Average Concentrations by Risk**:
  - Critical: 120ppm (Arsenic)
  - High: 113ppm (Lead 150ppm, Cadmium 95ppm, Mercury 102ppm)
  - Medium: 81.5ppm (Lead 88ppm, Mercury 75ppm)
  - Low: 122.5ppm (Plastic 200ppm, Chromium 45ppm)

#### Metrics
- **API Calls**: 4
- **Execution Time**: ~600ms
- **Success Rate**: 100%

## Scenario 4: Complex Filtering - High-Risk Operations

### Task
Find all high-risk operations by:
1. Getting shipments with critical/high risk contaminants
2. Cross-referencing with facility capacity
3. Identifying overloaded facilities handling dangerous waste
4. Ranking by risk score (concentration × facility load)

### Reference Agent (Me) - Approach

#### Reasoning
This requires combining data from multiple sources to identify high-risk scenarios. I need to correlate contamination data with facility capacity and current load to identify dangerous situations.

#### Steps
1. Get high-risk and critical contaminants
2. Get corresponding shipments
3. Get facility capacity and load data
4. Calculate risk scores and rank operations

#### Tool Calls Made
```bash
# Step 1: Get high-risk contaminants
curl -s "http://localhost:3001/api/contaminants-detected?risk_level=high"

# Step 2: Get critical contaminants  
curl -s "http://localhost:3001/api/contaminants-detected?risk_level=critical"

# Step 3: Get all facilities for capacity data
curl -s "http://localhost:3001/api/facilities"

# Step 4: Get shipments for contaminated items
curl -s "http://localhost:3001/api/shipments?has_contaminants=true"
```

#### Results
