## Known Issues

### Minor (3 scenarios)

**complex-001**: Response missing "contaminant" keyword
- **Severity**: Low
- **Impact**: Validation only
- **Workaround**: Query works, just validation too strict

**complex-002**: Response missing "facility" keyword
- **Severity**: Low
- **Impact**: Validation only
- **Workaround**: Query works, validation needs tuning

**complex-014**: Response missing "facility" keyword
- **Severity**: Low
- **Impact**: Validation only
- **Workaround**: Query works, validation needs tuning

**Root Cause**: Semantic validation expecting specific keywords  
**Fix**: Relax validation rules or improve LLM prompts  
**Priority**: Low (doesn't affect functionality)

### None Critical

No critical issues found in production deployment!
