# Agent Tester - Blueprint Documentation

**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Status:** Design Phase  
**Last Updated:** October 2025

## Overview

The Agent Tester is a comprehensive testing and validation framework for the Clear AI v2 agent system. It simulates real-world usage through the GraphQL API to validate functionality, performance, and reliability.

## What is the Agent Tester?

A standalone tool that:
- 🎯 Tests the entire agent pipeline end-to-end via GraphQL
- 📊 Validates results against expected behavior
- 📈 Tracks performance, costs, and quality metrics
- 🐛 Detects regressions before they reach production
- 🤖 Generates realistic test scenarios automatically
- 📝 Produces actionable reports and dashboards

## Why Build This?

Before building a client application or deploying to production, we need confidence that:
1. The system works correctly for diverse queries
2. Performance is acceptable under load
3. Costs are predictable and within budget
4. Edge cases are handled gracefully
5. Regressions are caught automatically

The Agent Tester provides this confidence through systematic testing.

## Key Features

### 🎯 Comprehensive Testing
- Simple queries (single tool)
- Complex queries (multiple tools, dependencies)
- Edge cases (errors, timeouts, invalid data)
- Performance tests (concurrent requests, load)
- Memory tests (context loading, retrieval)

### 📊 Rich Validation
- Schema validation (structure correctness)
- Data validation (content accuracy)
- Performance validation (latency, tokens)
- Semantic validation (meaning correctness)
- Business rule validation (domain logic)

### 📈 Deep Metrics
- End-to-end latency breakdown
- Token usage and LLM costs
- Tool selection accuracy
- Analysis quality scoring
- System health indicators

### 🐛 Regression Detection
- Baseline comparison
- Performance degradation alerts
- Accuracy regression detection
- Cost increase warnings
- Automated blocking in CI/CD

## Design Principles

1. **Non-Invasive** - Tests the system through its public GraphQL API
2. **Realistic** - Simulates actual user interactions
3. **Comprehensive** - Covers happy paths, edge cases, and failures
4. **Fast** - Full test suite runs in < 10 minutes
5. **Actionable** - Clear, specific failure reports
6. **Extensible** - Easy to add new scenarios
7. **Automated** - Zero-touch operation in CI/CD

## Example Scenario

```yaml
id: simple-query-001
name: "List recent shipments"
category: simple
description: "Test basic shipment listing with time filter"

query: "Get shipments from last week"

expected_behavior:
  tools_used: ["shipments"]
  min_results: 1
  response_contains: ["shipment", "week"]
  max_latency_ms: 5000
  max_tokens: 500

validation:
  - type: tool_selection
    expected: ["shipments"]
  - type: data_structure
    schema: shipment_list
  - type: semantic
    check: "Response mentions timeframe"
  - type: performance
    max_latency_ms: 5000
    max_tokens: 500
```

## Getting Started

### For Readers
1. Start with **[00-overview.md](./00-overview.md)** for the big picture
2. Read **[01-architecture.md](./01-architecture.md)** to understand the design
3. Review **[02-test-scenarios.md](./02-test-scenarios.md)** for scenario structure
4. Jump to **[09-implementation-phases.md](./09-implementation-phases.md)** for the roadmap

### For Implementers
1. Review all blueprints thoroughly
2. Start with Phase 1 in **[09-implementation-phases.md](./09-implementation-phases.md)**
3. Reference **[10-usage-examples.md](./10-usage-examples.md)** for patterns
4. Use **[08-data-management.md](./08-data-management.md)** for test data

### For Future Training
See **[11-training-integration.md](./11-training-integration.md)** for how this system will support model fine-tuning and continuous improvement.

## Success Criteria

The Agent Tester is considered successful when:

- ✅ Can run 100+ scenarios in < 10 minutes
- ✅ Catches regressions before production
- ✅ Provides actionable failure reports
- ✅ Tracks performance and cost trends
- ✅ Used daily by developers
- ✅ Integrated into CI/CD pipeline
- ✅ Blocks broken builds automatically

## Status

**Current Phase:** Blueprint Design  
**Next Phase:** Phase 1 Implementation (Core Testing)

See **[09-implementation-phases.md](./09-implementation-phases.md)** for detailed timeline.

## Questions or Feedback?

This is a living document. As you read through the blueprints:
- Note any unclear sections
- Identify missing considerations
- Suggest improvements
- Flag potential issues

The goal is a comprehensive, practical design that guides successful implementation.
