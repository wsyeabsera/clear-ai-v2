## Key Findings

### ✅ No Regressions from Deployment Changes
- API server binding to 0.0.0.0: Working
- GraphQL server binding to 0.0.0.0: Working
- Seed endpoint: Working
- All deployment-modified files: No new failures

### ⚠️ Pre-Existing Test Issues
- Planner agent tests have mock-related failures (existed before)
- Some integration tests timing out (known issue)

### ✅ Services Running Correctly
- Wasteer API: Port 4000 ✓
- GraphQL Server: Port 4001 ✓
- MongoDB: Local ✓
- Neo4j: Local ✓

## Next Steps
- Run agent tests to verify end-to-end functionality
- Document any new failures
- Test deployed services after local verification
