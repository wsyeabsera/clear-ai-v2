## How to Test in Cursor

### Option 1: Through Cursor Chat

Open Cursor and type commands like:

```
List all shipments that have contaminants
```

```
Get shipment S1 with all its contaminants
```

```
Show me contamination rate analytics
```

```
Get facility F1 with its recent activity from the last 30 days
```

```
Create a new shipment for facility F1
```

### Option 2: Direct Tool Invocation

In Cursor chat, you can directly invoke tools:

```
Use the shipments_list tool to find all delivered shipments
```

```
Use the facilities_get_with_activity tool for facility F2
```

```
Use the analytics_contamination_rate tool to show statistics
```

## Example Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic Query
**Ask:** "Show me all shipments from facility F1"
**Tool used:** `shipments_list` with `facility_id: "F1"`

### Scenario 2: Relationship Query
**Ask:** "Get shipment S2 with all its contaminants"
**Tool used:** `shipments_get_with_contaminants` with `id: "S2"`

### Scenario 3: Analytics
**Ask:** "What's the overall contamination rate?"
**Tool used:** `analytics_contamination_rate`

### Scenario 4: Complex Query
**Ask:** "Show me facility F1 with all its recent shipments and inspections"
**Tool used:** `facilities_get_with_activity` with `id: "F1", days: 30`

### Scenario 5: Create Operation
**Ask:** "Create a new inspection for shipment S3 at facility F1"
**Tool used:** `inspections_create` with required fields

### Scenario 6: Update Operation
**Ask:** "Update shipment S1 status to delivered"
**Tool used:** `shipments_update` with `id: "S1", status: "delivered"`
