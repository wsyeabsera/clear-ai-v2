## Performance

**Production vs Local**:
- Production: 5.54s average per query
- Local: 10.2s average per query
- **Production is 46% FASTER!** 🚀

---

## Simplified Workflow

### Old Approach (Removed)
```
Push → GitHub Actions → Tests → Build → Deploy → Verify
      ↓ (often fails)
   Complex CI/CD
```

### New Approach (Current)
```
Push → Railway Auto-Deploy → Manual Test → Done!
      ↓ (2-3 min)
   Simple & Reliable
```

**Benefits**:
- ✅ No failing CI/CD to debug
- ✅ Faster feedback (no CI queue)
- ✅ Direct control over testing
- ✅ Simpler to maintain

---

## How to Use

### After Each Push to Main

**1. Wait for Railway Deployment (2-3 minutes)**
- Monitor: https://railway.app/dashboard
- Look for green checkmark ✅

**2. Quick Health Check (30 seconds)**
```bash
curl https://wasteer-api-production.up.railway.app/health
curl https://clear-ai-v2-production.up.railway.app/health
```

**3. Run Tests (As Needed)**
```bash
# Unit tests (always)
yarn test

# Integration tests (for API changes)
yarn test:integration:deployed

# Agent tests (for major changes)
export GRAPHQL_DEPLOYED_URL="https://clear-ai-v2-production.up.railway.app/graphql"
yarn agent-tester:deployed
```

**4. Reseed Database (If Needed)**
```bash
curl -X POST https://wasteer-api-production.up.railway.app/api/reset
```
