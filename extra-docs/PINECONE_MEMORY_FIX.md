# Pinecone Semantic Memory - Fix Status

## What Was Fixed ‚úÖ

### 1. **Embedding Provider Changed: Ollama ‚Üí OpenAI**
- **Problem**: System was trying to use Ollama (`localhost:11434`) for embeddings, which doesn't exist in production
- **Solution**: Switched to OpenAI embeddings via API
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `MEMORY_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai` to `.env`
  - Added production fallback logic to automatically use OpenAI when Ollama is unavailable
  
**File Changed**: `src/shared/memory/embeddings.ts`
```typescript
// Auto-fallback to OpenAI in production if Ollama not specified
if (provider === 'ollama' && process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production' && !process.env.OLLAMA_URL) {
  console.warn('‚ö†Ô∏è  Ollama not configured for production, using OpenAI embeddings');
  provider = 'openai';
}
```

### 2. **Improved Error Logging**
- **Problem**: Memory storage errors were silently caught without details
- **Solution**: Added detailed logging to surface embedding/Pinecone errors
  
**File Changed**: `src/agents/orchestrator.ts`
```typescript
console.log('[OrchestratorAgent] Storing semantic memory...');
// ... store logic ...
console.log(`[OrchestratorAgent] ‚úÖ Stored request ${data.requestId} in memory (episodic + semantic)`);
```

### 3. **Local Testing Verified**
- ‚úÖ GraphQL server starts successfully
- ‚úÖ OpenAI embeddings are being generated (no Ollama errors)
- ‚úÖ Queries execute and return results
- ‚úÖ Logging shows "Storing semantic memory..." message

---

## Current Issue: Pinecone Index Not Found üîç

### Error in Logs
```
[OrchestratorAgent] ‚ùå Failed to store in memory: MemoryError: Memory operation failed: store
Failed to store semantic record: A call to https://api.pinecone.io/indexes/clear-ai returned HTTP status 404.
```

### Root Cause
The Pinecone API is returning **HTTP 404**, which means:
1. **Index doesn't exist** in your Pinecone account
2. **Index name is wrong** (looking for `clear-ai` but it's named something else)
3. **Region/Environment mismatch** (index exists but in different region)

### Your Current Configuration
From `.env`:
```bash
PINECONE_API_KEY=pcsk_6Qs2j3_PUo3CSQZHE6i1LhadazFNkVbP3Eg9ye9uYGzXec2wmrkgKrgCHbb8jqcWDZZxGm
PINECONE_ENVIRONMENT=us-east-1-aws
PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=clear-ai
```

## How to Fix the Pinecone Index Issue

### Option 1: Create the Index in Pinecone Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Go to** https://app.pinecone.io/
2. **Sign in** with your account
3. **Check existing indexes**:
   - If you see an index named `clear-ai` ‚Üí Verify it's in `us-east-1-aws` region
   - If no index exists ‚Üí Create a new one

4. **Create New Index** (if needed):
   - **Index Name**: `clear-ai` (must match `.env`)
   - **Dimensions**: `1536` (for OpenAI `text-embedding-3-small`)
   - **Metric**: `cosine` (recommended for semantic similarity)
   - **Cloud**: `AWS`
   - **Region**: `us-east-1`
   - **Plan**: `Starter` (free tier)

5. **Wait 1-2 minutes** for index to initialize

### Option 2: Use Existing Index

If you already have an index but with a different name:

1. Go to Pinecone Dashboard
2. Find your existing index
3. Copy its exact name
4. Update `.env`:
   ```bash
   PINECONE_INDEX_NAME=your-actual-index-name
   ```
5. Restart GraphQL server

### Option 3: Verify API Key Permissions

Your API key might not have access to the index:

1. Go to Pinecone Dashboard ‚Üí **API Keys**
2. Check that your API key has **read/write** permissions
3. If using a restricted key, ensure `clear-ai` index is in the allowed list

---

## Testing After Fix

Once you've created/verified the Pinecone index:

### 1. Restart GraphQL Server
```bash
cd /Users/yab/Projects/clear-ai-v2
# Kill existing server
lsof -ti:3001 | xargs kill -9

# Start fresh
yarn graphql:dev
```

### 2. Test a Query
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3001/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"mutation { executeQuery(query: \"Show me all shipments\") { message } }"}'
```

### 3. Check Logs for Success
You should see:
```
[OrchestratorAgent] Storing semantic memory...
[OrchestratorAgent] ‚úÖ Stored request abc-123 in memory (episodic + semantic)
```

No more "Failed to store in memory" errors!

### 4. Verify in Pinecone Dashboard
- Go to your `clear-ai` index
- Click "Vectors" tab
- You should see new vectors appearing after each query
- Vector count should increase: 0 ‚Üí 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí etc.

---

## For Production (Railway)

After fixing locally, update Railway:

### 1. Add Environment Variable
- Go to Railway Dashboard
- Select **GraphQL** service
- Add variable: `MEMORY_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai`

### 2. Push Code Changes
```bash
cd /Users/yab/Projects/clear-ai-v2
git push origin main
```

Railway will auto-deploy with the new embedding logic.

### 3. Test Production
```bash
# After deployment completes
curl -X POST https://your-graphql-url.railway.app/graphql \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"query":"mutation { executeQuery(query: \"test\") { message } }"}'
```

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] Pinecone index `clear-ai` exists in dashboard
- [ ] Index dimensions = 1536
- [ ] Index region = us-east-1-aws
- [ ] API key has access to index
- [ ] Local test shows "‚úÖ Stored request ... in memory"
- [ ] Pinecone dashboard shows new vectors
- [ ] Environment variable added to Railway
- [ ] Code pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Production deployment successful
- [ ] Production queries working
- [ ] No more HTTP 404 errors in logs

---

## Expected Outcome

‚úÖ **After Complete Fix:**
- OpenAI generates embeddings (~$0.00001 per query)
- Embeddings stored in Pinecone successfully
- Semantic search works for context loading
- Previous query context retrieved in new queries
- Memory system fully functional

**Pinecone Usage:**
- Free tier: 100k vectors
- Each query = 1 vector
- Plenty of capacity for testing/development

---

## Troubleshooting

### Still Getting 404?
1. Double-check index name (case-sensitive!)
2. Verify region matches exactly
3. Try recreating the index
4. Check API key hasn't expired

### Embeddings Taking Long?
- OpenAI API has rate limits
- Typical: 100-200ms per embedding
- No issue for normal usage

### Want to Use Ollama Locally?
Keep `MEMORY_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=ollama` for local dev:
- Requires Ollama running: `ollama serve`
- Requires model: `ollama pull nomic-embed-text`
- Free embeddings (offline)
- Slower but works without API costs

---

## Files Modified

- ‚úÖ `.env` - Added `MEMORY_EMBEDDING_PROVIDER=openai`
- ‚úÖ `src/shared/memory/embeddings.ts` - Added production fallback
- ‚úÖ `src/agents/orchestrator.ts` - Improved error logging
- ‚úÖ Committed to Git: `a6a8a1b`

---

## Next Steps

1. **Create Pinecone Index** (see Option 1 above)
2. **Test Locally** (see Testing section)
3. **Update Railway** (add env var)
4. **Push to Production**
5. **Verify** everything works

**Estimated Time:** 5-10 minutes

---

## Summary

The embedding system now works with OpenAI! üéâ

The only remaining issue is the Pinecone index. Once you create it in the Pinecone dashboard, semantic memory will be fully operational.

- Pinecone Docs: https://docs.pinecone.io/
- Index creation takes 1-2 minutes, be patient!
