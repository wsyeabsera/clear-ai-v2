## 📋 Required GitHub Secrets

You need to add these secrets in GitHub → Settings → Secrets → Actions:

1. ✅ `OPENAI_API_KEY` - Your OpenAI API key
2. ✅ `STAGING_GRAPHQL_ENDPOINT` - Your Railway GraphQL URL (when deployed)
3. ⏳ `MONGODB_CLOUD_URI` - Your MongoDB Atlas connection string
4. ⏳ `NEO4J_CLOUD_URI` - Your Neo4j Aura URI
5. ⏳ `NEO4J_CLOUD_USERNAME` - Your Neo4j username
6. ⏳ `NEO4J_CLOUD_PASSWORD` - Your Neo4j password
7. ⏳ `PINECONE_API_KEY` - Your Pinecone API key

**Note**: These are only needed when you want to run the full agent tests in CI/CD.

## 🚀 Testing the Setup

### 1. Test GitHub Actions Workflow

The workflow will automatically run on the next commit. You can also:

```bash
# Create a test branch
git checkout -b test/verify-ci-cd

# Make a small change
echo "# CI/CD Test" >> TEST.md

# Commit and push
git add TEST.md
git commit -m "test: Verify CI/CD pipeline"
git push origin test/verify-ci-cd

# Open a PR and watch the workflow run
```

### 2. Test Manual Seed Workflow

1. Go to: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/clear-ai-v2/actions
2. Click "Manual Database Seed" in the left sidebar
3. Click "Run workflow" button
4. Select environment (staging or production)
5. Click "Run workflow"

### 3. Test Wasteer API

```bash
# Get all shipments
curl https://wasteer-api-production.up.railway.app/api/shipments | jq '.data[0]'

# Get all facilities
curl https://wasteer-api-production.up.railway.app/api/facilities | jq '.data[0]'

# Get contaminants
curl https://wasteer-api-production.up.railway.app/api/contaminants-detected | jq '.count'

# Get inspections
curl https://wasteer-api-production.up.railway.app/api/inspections | jq '.count'
```

## 📊 Implementation Summary

### Files Created
- ✅ `src/api/routes/seed.ts` - Seed endpoint (ready for future use)
- ✅ `.github/workflows/agent-tests.yml` - CI/CD workflow
- ✅ `.github/workflows/seed-database.yml` - Manual seed workflow
- ✅ `.github/pull_request_template.md` - PR template

### Files Modified

## 🐛 Issues Resolved

1. **Railway "Application failed to respond"**
   - **Cause**: App listening on `localhost` instead of `0.0.0.0`
   - **Fix**: Changed `app.listen(PORT)` to `app.listen(PORT, '0.0.0.0')`
   - **Status**: ✅ Resolved

2. **Railway PORT mismatch**
   - **Cause**: Manually set `PORT=3001` in env vars
   - **Fix**: Removed manual PORT variable, let Railway auto-assign
   - **Status**: ✅ Resolved

3. **MongoDB connection issues**
   - **Cause**: Using `MONGODB_LOCAL_URI` in production
   - **Fix**: Added `NODE_ENV=production` check and `MONGODB_CLOUD_URI`
   - **Status**: ✅ Resolved

4. **GitHub Actions Yarn 4 error**
   - **Cause**: Corepack not enabled in workflow
   - **Fix**: Added `corepack enable` step before `yarn install`
   - **Status**: ✅ Resolved

5. **Seed endpoint not deploying**
   - **Cause**: Railway build cache
   - **Workaround**: Used existing `/api/reset` endpoint instead
   - **Status**: ✅ Resolved (database seeded successfully)
